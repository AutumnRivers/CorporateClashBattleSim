# Corporate Clash Battle Simulator
A website that allows you to simulate a cog battle in Corporate Clash. Perfect if you don't know how much damage a combo will do, and want to plan out your strategy beforehand.

This is a **static** site so no setup is required to run it. Just open index.html.

## Need-to-know
* This simulator always assumes your gags always hit - there's no accuracy in this.
* If you want to represent a toon that's skipping a turn, then use Toon-Up for that toon. It's a useless gag in here.
* Do NOT try to factor in combos - those are calculated on their own
* If you manually set a cog as lured / soaked (as in, not using lure / squirt to do the deed), it will stay that way until you manually disable lure / soak.

## Planned Features
**Zapping / Zap Jumps** - Zapping is currently DISABLED in this simulator due to zap jumps being a nightmare to code in. It's sort of implemented, but you're not going to get accurate damage representation, so I'd recommend not enabling it. If you would like to help fix these and you know JavaScript, I would be very grateful.

**SOS Cards** - Currently, this doesn't factor in SOS Cards, such as ones that up your damage. However, this might be implemented in the future.

**Gag Presets** - As of right now, you must put in the gag damage manually. This may change in the future with gag presets, but I wouldn't hold out on it.
